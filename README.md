# Introduction

This repository is used for recording my note when I start to learn node.js.

The note content extracts from a udemy course called "Learn and Understand NodeJS". I am not sure if I make this note will be illeagle or not. Therefore, if any things about
infringement of copyright, please tell me and I will take it off or close this repository. Thanks.
