# Modules, import and Export

# Modules

Definition: A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.

JavaScript does not have this concept before ES6. Node.js supports modules from 8.5.0. Before that, node.js has workaround to make your code as module-like.

# first-class function and function expression

## First-class function

You can see funcions as variables, assign value, assign to array. Just operate like other types.

## Expression

A block of code results a value.

example:

```
3
"T"
```

## function expression

example:

```
var a = function(sth) {
  console.log(sth);
}
```
