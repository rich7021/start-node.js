# JSON

## Introduction

This Chapter only simply introduce what is JSON. Because of I am a experienced engineer in this field, I already know this, I do not describe too much here.

## What is JSON?

It's a format to structuring data. Something like

```json
{
  "name": "Richard Fu",
  "id": "77459",
  "properties": {
    "cars": [
      {
        "brand": "Lamborghini",
        "licience": "AAA-001"
      },
      {
        "brand": "Porsche",
        "licience": "CCC-100"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
